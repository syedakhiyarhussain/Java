public class Destructor{
    // Destructor is a special member function of a class that is executed whenever an object of its class goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.
    // It is used to free resources that were allocated to the object. In Java, destructors are not explicitly defined as in C++.
    // Instead, Java has a garbage collector that automatically handles memory management and object destruction.
